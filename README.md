### Prerequisites

- A computer with Python 3 install. Check [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for
  further [instructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- Access to the Internet
- An IDE of your choice e.g. Pycharm, VS Code, Sublime Text

### Installing

Before starting the application, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the project dependencies.

To run the app, unzip the cloned folder if it is zipped. Otherwise, navigate inside the folder and
run ```python manage.py runserver``` or ```python manage.py server``` in your terminal. Any of these 2 should start the
server at
localhost:8000. Once the server is running, open your browser and enter localhost:8000 in your url bar of your
preferred browser, and you should be able to use the app now. This will only work on the computer running the server. It
is not available to anyone else. You should see something similar to the image below on clicking a single image.
